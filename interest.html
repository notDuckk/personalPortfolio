    <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>

    <p>I have a deep passion for both cars and software development, finding joy and fulfillment in each for different reasons. My love for cars began in childhood, admiring their engineering marvels and the thrill of driving. Separately, I am also deeply interested in software development, enjoying the challenge of creating and problem-solving through code. I find immense satisfaction in developing applications that can improve various aspects of life and business. Balancing these interests allows me to explore diverse fields and stay engaged in continuously evolving landscapes. Ultimately, my dual passions keep me inspired and motivated to learn and innovate.</p>
